              <p>
              NeuroGuard is a full-stack application inspired by my grandmother, who is at risk of falling due to mild dementia and dizziness.
               The project uses AI/ML technologies to support Alzheimer's patients and caregivers, featuring fall detection, an AI chatbot for caregiver assistance, and an emergency alert system.
                The backend leverages OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time motion analysis, while the chatbot integrates GPT-4 and Voiceflow for personalized support. The front-end, built with React.js and Flask, ensures a seamless user experience. 
                This project helped me gain valuable experience in full-stack development, machine learning, and real-time data processing, with plans to expand its impact by providing behavioral insights to healthcare professionals.</p>

              GeeseSpotter is a text-based, single-player game developed in C++ that replicates a unique version of Minesweeper with a creative Waterloo twist. 
              The goal is to identify which fields contain geese by interpreting clues from neighboring fields that indicate the presence of geese through droppings. 
              This project allowed me to apply core programming concepts such as functions, bitwise operations, arrays, and dynamic memory allocation to build an engaging, interactive game. 
              Through this experience, I strengthened my skills in C++ and learned how to implement game logic, manage memory dynamically, and develop a console-based application with an emphasis on efficiency and user experience. 
              (Project's main purpose was to learn and develop skills mentioned =>)</p></div>

              Humor Haven is an interactive website built using PHP and MySQL, hosted on an Apache web server. 
              The website serves as a fun, user-friendly platform for accessing a wide variety of jokes and puns, aimed at boosting personality and charm. 
              Users can browse jokes based on specific keywords or contribute their own to the site. 
              This project gave me hands-on experience with web development technologies such as PHP, HTML, and MySQL, and helped me sharpen my skills in server-side programming and database management. 
              Additionally, the website is encrypted to ensure security, demonstrating my ability to implement web security practices alongside dynamic web development. (Project was created to help practice new skills for internship - SWD intern @ PinkByte)</p></div>

              <p>
              I helped design and engineer a waterproof battery box for an electric skateboard, enhancing durability and optimizing balance. 
              Using SolidWorks for precise CAD modeling, I incorporated material selection, waterproofing techniques, and manufacturing processes to protect the battery in harsh conditions. 
              I also focused on optimizing the center of gravity for improved stability and performance. This project involved a blend of mechanical and electrical engineering skills, including CAD design, material analysis, balance optimization, and hardware integration.
